  + month – Month of contact.
  + duration – Last contact duration in seconds.
  + campaign – Number of contacts performed during this campaign.
  + pdays – Days passed since the client was last contacted (-1 = never contact).
Since pdays = -1 represents clients never contacted before, it was grouped as a separate category (Never)
  + previous – Number of contacts before this campaign.
  + poutcome – Outcome of the previous campaign.
  + deposit – Target variable: Did the client subscribe to a term deposit? (yes/no).
⚠️ **Disclaimer:**
- In this dataset, the target variable (`deposit`) has been oversampled and balanced, resulting in an unusually high proportion of positive cases (~46%).
- This distribution does not reflect the real-world deposit rate (≈11% in the original dataset).
- Therefore, this dataset is intended for machine learning practice (predictive modeling), not for deriving business insights or action plans.
- In another version (Version 2 - Dataset 2), we will user another dataset to explore business insights and action plans more aligned with real-world scenarios.
